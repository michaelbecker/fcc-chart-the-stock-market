## Chart the Stock Market

Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <http://watchstocks.herokuapp.com/> and deploy it to Heroku.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit <https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects>.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

* *User Story:* I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
* *User Story:* I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
* *User Story:* I can remove stocks.
* *User Story:* I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
